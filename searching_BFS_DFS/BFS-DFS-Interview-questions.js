//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS - it starts searching the closest node to the parent first

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, 
BFS
DFS - we use recursion in DFS which will take long time because the tree is very deep and the solutions are rare

//If the tree is very wide: - meaning there are a ton of nodes underneath each parent
DFS
BFS will need too much memory because it needs to keep track of the nodes at each level

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
DFS

//determining whether a path exists between two nodes
DFS

//Finding the shortest path
BFS
